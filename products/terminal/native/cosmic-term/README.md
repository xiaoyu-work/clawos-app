# cosmic-term
COSMIC terminal emulator, built using [alacritty\_terminal](https://docs.rs/alacritty_terminal) that is provided by the [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) project. `cosmic-term` provides bidirectional rendering and ligatures with a custom renderer based on [cosmic-text](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text).

The `wgpu` feature, enabled by default, supports GPU rendering using `glyphon`
and `wgpu`. If `wgpu` is not enabled or fails to initialize, then rendering falls
back to using `softbuffer` and `tiny-skia`.

## Color Schemes

Custom color schemes can be imported from the `View -> Color schemes...` menu item.
You can find templates for color schemes in the [color-schemes](color-schemes) folder.

## Claw OS MCP service

The App Host starts `/usr/bin/cosmic-term` with `COS_MCP_SERVER=1`.
The product's `apps/cosmic-term/app.json` owns the audited command, PATH lookup, and
terminal-launch tool definitions and capability needs.
The private compiled-in command library shares Terminal's bounded execution
and environment scrubbing without invoking the `exec` App. OS services own
policy, filesystem snapshots and fixed native launch. See the product
[`MODULE.md`](../../MODULE.md) for standalone build/test commands.
