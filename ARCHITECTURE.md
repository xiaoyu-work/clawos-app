# Application Architecture

`clawos-app` owns independently developed application products. `claw-os`
owns the system Agent, privileged broker, runtime authority, SDK and OS image.

Applications do not call one another. One product can have multiple entry
points without duplicating its account state or inheriting a union of grants.

| Surface | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| `products/mail/` | Thunderbird source, Mail AI, legacy email transport, extension UI and product packaging |
| `tools/stage.py` | Deterministic assembly of product-owned installed assets |
| `platform.lock.json`, `tools/platform_dependency.py` | Immutable development SDK/runtime dependency, not a second OS implementation |
| `tools/test.py` | Product-scoped tests using the locked runtime |
| `claw-os` | Native authority launcher, package signing, installation, core services and system integration |

OS builds pin a commit of this repository and invoke the product asset builder.
The resulting assets enter the existing signed OS package; installed paths and
App provenance checks do not change. No installed system downloads a mutable
Git branch or silently substitutes an unverified App.

Mail preserves `mail-ai` and its six AI operations, plus the existing `email`
SMTP/Gmail/Outlook implementation. Native Thunderbird source is also owned
here. `gateway-email` has not moved yet. These source moves do not merge
legacy identities or account state; completing that product cutover requires
explicit account, consent and installation changes.

SDK/runtime development dependencies are fetched by immutable commit into
ignored build storage. Only those library source directories are checked out;
product code does not import operating-system implementation files. Published
runtime packages can replace this source dependency without changing the
product interface. The legacy email transport also uses the pinned
`apps/_shared` package and the sibling `canonical_argv.py` shared module
(included by the sparse checkout's parent directory). No other App's
implementation is checked out. OS package assembly already owns these
installed libraries.
