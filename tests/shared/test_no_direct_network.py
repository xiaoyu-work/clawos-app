"""Contract test: no shipped sandboxed operation dials directly.

Every App operation and gateway runs inside the OS worker sandbox.
There it has no route and, under the
worker seccomp filter, may create only ``AF_UNIX`` sockets, so a direct
`socket` / `urlopen` / `smtplib` dial is not a slower path — it is a
failure that surfaces as a confusing ``EPERM`` at the worst moment.

This walks the shipped Python and refuses any raw network call that is
not on the explicit exception list below. Adding a hit here is a
deliberate act with a written reason, which is the point: the
alternative is a migration silently regressing the next time somebody
copies an old snippet.

It is a maintenance control, not a security boundary: the kernel is the
boundary, and the sandbox refuses an ``AF_INET`` socket whatever this
file says. What it buys is that the refusal is found in review rather
than by a user whose calendar stopped syncing. It therefore resolves
import aliases and local rebindings before matching, so
``from urllib.request import urlopen`` and ``import socket as s`` are
caught as readily as the dotted spelling.

Run it like the rest of the bundled suite::

    python3 tools/test.py --shared
